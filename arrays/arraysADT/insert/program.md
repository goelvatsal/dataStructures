**Input:**
1. Array structure with
    2. Array with [20]int type
    3. Length of array
    4. Number of elements in array
5. Index of new number in array
5. Number to insert in array

**Output:**
1. New array structure with the new number inserted at the index location

**Process:**
1. Creates a decrementing loop that assigns the previous location's value to the following one
2. Sets the index location value to new number
3. Increases length of array
4. Efficiency of O(n) max, O(1) min
